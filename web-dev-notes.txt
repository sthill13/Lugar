Making a new section:

1. Wrapper div
2. container inside that wrapper div
3. all of the content inside that container by making a new div
4. image will always be in a div, you will not give width and height in px to actual img tag
5. Divide the section or make them in group as much as you can with flex, or calculating width in percentages
6. Don't copy the absolute values from figma
position: absolute;
width: 540px;
height: 174px;
left: 735px;
top: 999px;
7. Don't use margin-top, instead use margin-bottom of parent element, or padding-top.
8. To make the element move out of normal flow, we give it position: absolute. By default it will move in the whole page. So, we give it's parent element may be (just assuming scenario) a postion: relative, so it will move only in that element.
9. When dividing the section in two halves, give parent element 100% width and child calc(100%/2)
10. Section spacing will be applied to section that means the parent element of all the content of that section even before the container.
11. flex-wrap moves the overfow items to next line
12. display: initial makes the element back to origin
